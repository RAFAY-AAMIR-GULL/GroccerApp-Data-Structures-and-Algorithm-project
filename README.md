>I have made a Grocery management system like GrocerApp using OOP and Data Structures:

• **Link List**

• **Hash Table**

• **Bloom Filter**

• **Stack**

• **Queue**

and many others ☺ and pointers as well.


A customer can see the listed products, buy them and fill up the cart. Customer can edit and delete any item from the cart. And at last customer’s cart will be delivered to the specified address by our employee and customer will be given a complete detail of that employee. When the order will be delivered that employee will be added/pushed into the queue and every customer will be assigned an employee according to the order of employees in the queue. An employee can see all products and their quantity as well. Employee can add, delete, edit any product.
